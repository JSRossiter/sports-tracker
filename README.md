# Sports Tracker

An app for tracking live scores for all your favorite sports

Hosted at https://stark-falls-80172.herokuapp.com/
As this app was built to consume data from a paid API it currently only shows MLB games from Apr 24 2016 but it can be easily converted to display live scores for many sports given available data.

The purpose of this repo is to combine the server and client side projects for deployment to heroku.
